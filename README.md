# DataScience-and-ML-Projects

until now this repo contains 4 stages in my learning path as a machine learning engineer and a data scientist. it is organized from stages W - to - Z from the latest as W to the earliest projects as Z.
## Stage Z: data visualization and data preprocessing
contains 5 files:
- Uber Data Analysis.ipynb
- Sales_Analysis_1.ipynb
- Sales_Analysis_2.ipynb
- pre-processing Loan Data.ipynb
- pre-processing Black Friday.ipynb

this was my earliest practices inculding different preprocessing operations on different datafiles and including some visualizations as well to enable me to select the appropriate preprocessing technique

## Stage Y: some early stage Machine learning and storytelling (creating insights from the data through charts and plots)
contains 3 files and a folder:
- Diamonds_classification_Visualization_and_preprocessing_stage.ipynb
- Diamonds_classification_stage.ipynb
- 50ulke data set Story telling.ipynb
- FOLDER : Comparing-the-performance-of-SVM-and-KNN-classification-techniques-master

The diamond project was my first end-to-end Machine learning project, starting from domain understanding to the prediction and model enhancement stage. in this project I was able to achieve 98.45676 accuracy score for the diamond classification problem
the Folder contains an implementation of code for comparing the performance of the basic classifiers: SVM and KNN. There are 2 implementation codes one was done using randomly generated matrices the other was implemented on a very small data set of dogs and flower images (the images are the reason why it is contained in a folder).

## Stage X: Comparing the performance of regression techniques I learnt on different datasets and in different preprocessing stages to gain better understanding of the use cases of each model
contains 4 files:
- comparing Regression techniques -Small Dataset-WITH Feature Engineering-diabetes,csv.ipynb
- comparing Regression techniques -Small Dataset-NO Feature Engineering-diabetes,csv.ipynb
- comparing Regression techniques -Large Dataset-WITH Feature Engineering-Salaries,csv.ipynb
- comparing Regression techniques -Large Dataset-NO Feature Engineering-Salaries,csv.ipynb

The results are documented in the files

## Stage W: More Practice of ML concepts - Alitle more advanced projects
contains 2 files:
- Classification of Social_Network_Ads_csv.ipynb
- Regression of 50_startups_csv.ipynb
